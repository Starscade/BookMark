# Overview

**BookMark** is a shorthand syntax for writing HTML in plaintext. I call it a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy) flavor, but it borrows from [Textile](https://textile-lang.com/) as well. Anyone familiar with Markdown should find BookMark easy to learn, and most Markdown editors should render BookMark files more or less accurately. However, the two are *not* interchangeable.

For details on the syntax itself, please refer to SYNTAX.md.
